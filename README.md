# couchdb4livecode
Daybed - A Library for Apache CouchDB

Functions:

      couch.get(pFunk,pURL,pDB,pDocID,pParams,pOptions,pFormat)
The couch.get function retrives a document, multiple documents, or information.

      couch.put(pFunk,pURL,pDB,pDoc,pParams,pOptions,pFormat)
The couch.put function inserts a value or a document into a database.

      couch.post(pFunk,pURL,pDB,pDoc,pParams,pOptions,pFormat)
The couch.post function inserts multiple documents or values into a database.

      couch.delete(pFunk,pURL,pDB,pDocID,pParams,pOptions,pFormat)
The couch.delete function deletes a document or database, or a config key.

Note: the database is really deleted, however the document can still be retrieved if the id and rev are known.

pFunk - (always required) Couch function being called, without the leading underscore, for example "all_docs"

		a list is included below of functions that have been tested

		there are four categories of functions:  system, database, document, design document

pURL - (always required) the URL of the CouchDB installation, including "http://", the port numer and a trailing slash

		For example:   "http://192.168.23.42:5984/"

		With username/password:    "http://admin:trustno1@192.168.23.42:5984/"

pDB - (required when acting on or retrieving from a database) - the name of the database being accessed
		should be blank for system functions, must be included for database, document, and design document
		
pDocID - (for get and delete functions) the document "_id" being retrieved
		should be blank for system and database functions, must be included for document and design document 
    for design documents, use the pDocID param to specify it
		for selecting a view from a design document, add a slash with the view name to pDocID, for example:
			for the following view call /_design/querymon/_view/phone
			put querymon/phone into pDocID
		
pDoc - (for put and post functions) array containing the data being converted into a document for the database
		should be blank for system functions, must be included in document and design document (also used in a db function)

pParams - an array with any OPTIONAL parameters, with the parameter as a key.
		These parameters are specified in the CouchDB API
		For example:  to download documents when running the _all_docs function, and limit the list to only 10 records:
     put true into tParams["include_docs"]
     put 10 into tParams["limit"]

pOptions - (optional) header options, including user and pass (see "Authentication"), also used in "config" operations
also can include pOptions["format"] with "array", "rawjson" or "prettyjson" for the return format
the stack can have a customProperty called "preferredFormat" which can be one of those three values,
if pOptions["format"] is blank, then "preferredFormat" will be used, if it is not set, then "array" will be used

      couch.securedb(pFunk,pURL,pDB,pOptions,pAdminNames,pAdminRoles,pMemberNames,pMemberRoles)
The couch.securedb function sets the "_security" document for the specified database.
pFunk - "set" (replace current security), "add" adds user/roles to existing security, "delete" removes user/roles from existing

* pAdminNames - sets the given names up with admin rights (read,write,delete)
* pAdminRoles - sets the given user roles up with admin rights (read,write,delete)
* pMemberNames - sets the given names up with member rights (read only)
* pMemberRoles - sets the given user roles up with member rights (read only)

      couch.adduserdb(pURL,pUser,pPass,pOptions)
The couch.adduser function inserts a new record into the "_users" database, creates a database for the user, and 
sets the new user as the admin and member (which makes that user the only one who can access it).
pUsername - Username of the person signing up.
pPassword - Password for the account
pOptions["roles"] - can be used to assign the user to roles, must be in a numbered array
Note:  only an admin can create a user

      couch.peruserDB(pUsername)
Requires "couchperuser" to be installed (https://github.com/etrepum/couchperuser)
The couch.peruserDB function returns the database name associated with the username specified.

Authentication: if the CouchDB URL requires authentication, it can be achieved in one of two ways:

Option 1: include the username and password as part of the URL, for example:
"http://admin:passw0rd@192.168.0.42:5984/"

Option 2: use the pOptions parameter, and the script will encode the username and password into the httpheaders:
put "admin" into pOptions["user"]
put "passw0rd" into pOptions["pass"]

Option 3: use the pOptions parameter with a base 64 encoded username:password, which will be added to the httpheaders:
for example, put base64encode("username:password") will yield the string below:
put "dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=" into pOptions["userpasscode"]

Option 4: use cookies/sessions... 
First  get cookie by posting username and password to sessions
   put "admin" into pDoc["name"]     
   put "passw0rd" into pDoc["password"]
   put couch.post("session",tURL,,pDoc) into theCookie
Store it somewhere. For each subsequent call, send theCookie in pOptions
   put theCookie into pOptions["cookie"]

NOTE: a library for decoding and encoding JSON needs to be added, I recommend one of these:
